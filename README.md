# AI for the Industry 4.0

## Description

A company producing fiber optic sensors decided to implement the concept
of Industry 4.0 in one of their production processes. They are going to
implement the AI techniques to automate verification of produced sensors.
Currently, after the production of the sensor, its characteristics should be
verified each time in three reference substances in order to configure:

*   Air
*   Water
*   Isopropanol

After the procedure in the laboratory they collected three spectroscopic
signals. Unfortunately, such procedures are extremely time consuming and
require large human resources. Therefore they are planning to implement AI
algorithms in order to predict characteristics (or any other parameters â€“ you
can propose something) of a working sensor in water and isopropanol based
on measured characteristics in air. It will enable to reduce validation process
only to measurements in the air, but other characteristics will be collected
based on the proposed model.

Dataset of manufactured sensors:<br>

It's a collection of measurements based on 10 sensors . Each sensor was
measured three times that you can find in three separated files (e.g.
sensor01_air.txt, sensor01_water.txt, sensor01_izopropanol.txt). Each file
contains two-dimensional signal (signal wavelength, signal amplitude) as you
can observe in figure 1.

Based on this characteristics you can use any data mining and machine learning techniques. Of course you can use any mechanisms e.g. data enrichment, feature extraction, signal analysis, etc. The ultimate goal of this task is facing the real problem and design and plan AI implementation plan.
